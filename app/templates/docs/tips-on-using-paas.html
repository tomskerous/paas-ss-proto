      <h1>Tips on using PaaS</h1>

      <h2>Configure your deployment</h2>

      <p>Use a manifest.yml file to automatically configure your app and reduce the complexity of your push command or add extra instances for resilience
      Stop and remove your app.</p>

      <h2>Free up space</h2>
      <p>cf stop will cancel your running app, but it will still have an active URL (“route” in Cloud Foundry speak) and count against your quota. </p>
      <p>To completely remove an app and any active routes run:</p>
      <pre><code>cf delete -r</code> </pre>

      <p>If your still need more space contact support to talk about increasing your quota above the free tier.</p>

      <h2>Work with more spaces</h2>
      <p>Contact your org admin to create a new space. To find out who they are run:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>cf orgs
cf org-users</code>
      </pre>
      <h2>Take your prototype to the next level</h2>
      <p>Work with developers to try adding databases or other backing services - this can help you start investigating how GOV.UK PaaS could help you during the Beta phase of your project</p>
